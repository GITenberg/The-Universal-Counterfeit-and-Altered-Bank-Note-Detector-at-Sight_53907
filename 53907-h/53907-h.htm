<h2>Notices by the Press of the “Universal Counterfeit Detector.”</h2>

<div class="testimonial">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Counterfeit Bank-Note Detector at Sight.</span>”&mdash;We have seen a
little pamphlet of 20 pages, by H. C. Foote, of 763 Greenwich-street,
N. Y., with this title. It gives eight rules, with illustrative diagrams,
by an acquaintance with which, any person may readily distinguish
the engraving of a counterfeit bill from a genuine one&mdash;founded upon
the principle that no counterfeiter, working with his hand, can possibly
attain the beauty and accuracy of engraving by the perfect and
costly machinery of professional engravers. The difference between
the two is shown by the diagrams. The writer says he has never seen
a counterfeit which a judgment by these rules would not condemn at
sight. Well-informed dealers in Bank Notes usually act upon this
principle, but Mr. Foote has here attempted to give rules and explanations
to render it more clear and easily understood, and by which
every man may judge for himself. Its price is $2. We think, with
Mr. Edmonds, Cashier of the Mechanics’ Bank, N. Y., that it will be
“exceedingly serviceable to any one who will give it due attention.”&mdash;<cite>Newark
Daily Advertiser.</cite></p>

</div>

<div class="testimonial">

<p><span class="smcap">Counterfeit Detector.</span>&mdash;Our readers will notice in another column
the advertisement of H. C. Foote’s Universal Counterfeit Detector. We
have examined the system, and have no hesitation in stating that it
will do more than all others now in use towards ridding the country of
counterfeit notes. The instructions which accompany the magnifying
glass will enable a person, with very little trouble, to determine between
good and bad notes. We notice among those who have recommended
the system, the names of F. W. Edmonds, Esq. Cashier of the
Mechanics’ Bank, N. Y.; E. H. Arthur, Esq. of the Union Bank; C. S.
Sloane, Broker, Wall street, and many other prominent money dealers.
From what we can learn, we should think it a subject of universal interest.&mdash;<cite>Scientific

of which will render every one fully competent to detect any counterfeit
or altered Bank Note at sight. From an examination into the system
we are convinced that the knowledge derived from the little work
in question will be of essential interest to every tradesman, and we
therefore commend it to their attention and consideration. By an advertisement
in another column it will be perceived that Mr. Foote will
give lessons in his system, to all who may desire it.&mdash;<cite>New York Atlas</cite>,

<p><cite>Water Cure Institute, Saratoga Spa</cite>, Sept. 12th. 1849.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To whom it may

moral character, of excellent business habits, of strict integrity,
and is scrupulously honest. He professes nothing he is not
competent to perform. The business he is now engaged in is, and must
be, of great individual and public benefit, and a direct means of preventing
men from attempting to prey upon the community by fraud.
If all that handle money had the knowledge of detecting spurious
Bank Notes at sight, the trade would become extinct. Mr. Foote can
impart this knowledge in one hour to any person of ordinary observation.
We most heartily commend him and his art to the public.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Heretofore the best judges of money have had nothing as a guide in
judging at sight but experience in handling money, a familiarity with
the notes of a few particular banks, and the general appearance of a
note. They become familiar with a certain (to them) undefined perfect
appearance, generally possessed by genuine notes, and any apparent
want of which creates suspicion as to the genuineness of a note;
but the first impression, they affirm, is the best, as sometimes upon continued
examination the judgment, having no particular guide, wavers,
gets confused, and is often at fault. Now this uncertainty may be entirely
obviated, and the detection of counterfeits at sight reduced to a
perfect science or mathematical certainty; and this great desideratum
is held to be perfectly attained in the rules here presented, when combined
with a little practice in handling money.</p>

<p>All genuine Bank Notes in the United States are engraved upon one
uniform principle, by regular Bank-note Engraving Companies. A
company consists of ten to twenty first-class artists, each perfect in his
own department; there is required a heavy capital to be invested, and
the use of perfect, costly and inimitable machinery. Since the invention
of the Geometric Lathe, Ruling Engine, and Medallion Ruling,
and the invention of transferring engravings by Perkins, it has been
rendered entirely out of the question&mdash;in fact, a physical impossibility&mdash;for
any genuine note to be perfectly imitated. Counterfeiters cannot
procure all the machinery; and even supposing they could, it would
be against their own interest to invest $50,000 to $100,000 in an illegitimate
business, to run the hazardous risk of seizure and confiscation.
It would be more to their interest to invest that amount in any honest
business. They therefore attempt to imitate the several kinds of inimitable
engine-work by hand, and the imitations thus produced vary in
character from miserably poor to tolerable, and sometimes exceedingly
close imitations&mdash;deceiving the best judges who do not understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
principle, but detected at a glance by any one understanding it, as it is
explained and illustrated in the following pages. Sometimes they get
hold of one or more worn-out stolen genuine dies and use them in their
issues&mdash;and so far their work will be genuine; but there is always
enough else of the other portions of the work to indicate a counterfeit
note.</p>

<p>The following items, quoted from newspapers (June, 1850), will serve
to show the necessity of the diffusion of some system of infallible detection
at sight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="testimonial">

<p>🖙 “The Western States, it is said, are flooded with $2 bills of the
State Bank, Indiana.”&mdash;<cite>Times.</cite></p>

</div>

<div class="testimonial">

<p>🖙 The <cite>Boston Traveller</cite> of Wednesday, June 5th, says, “It is not
supposed that counterfeit money is manufactured in this city. The
greater part of the money of this description which has for years flooded
the country, comes from Canada, where, from various causes, its
manufacturers have been left comparatively undisturbed, to carry on
their nefarious business. … It is not perhaps
an exaggeration to say that traders in our city are cheated out of
at least $50,000 annually, by means of counterfeit money.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now in New York city, which is four times larger than Boston, this
system has been pretty generally diffused among the merchants for
nine months past, and it may be safely predicted that for the year 1850
there will not be one-tenth, or even a twentieth of the above sum lost
here by counterfeits. Men who handle any money should not refuse to
expend the trifling sum to learn this system. They should reflect that
besides it being against their own interests to remain ignorant of it,
their neglect to learn it <em>is just so much encouragement to counterfeiters</em>, because
the less this system is spread the greater the chance for counterfeit
money to circulate and defraud the public; therefore, every honest
man should put his shoulder to the wheel to facilitate the diffusion of
the system, and thereby assist to drive all spurious money out of circulation.
The different periodical Bank-note Lists are excellent guides, <em>as
far as they go</em>, but they do not and cannot go far enough. They assist too
often <em>after</em> the mischief is done. In hundreds of cases their description
of counterfeits is necessarily vague and uncertain, especially where
the counterfeit is a <em>fac-simile</em> of the genuine: they never make a man a
good judge of money <em>at sight</em>. But the greatest trouble is that new
counterfeits, it is said, are generally “rushed” in upon the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
preconcertedly, from different points at once, and the greatest mischief
is often done before they have time to get the description in the List.
Now this system will enable the poorest judge to detect <em>any</em> counterfeit,
<em>new</em> or old, <span class="smcapuc">AT SIGHT</span>. It is arranged systematically into seven rules,
simple and comprehensive at a glance of the eye. For self-instruction
a magnifying glass will be of great assistance at first in learning the
principle, and afterwards the naked eye will be sufficient to detect, but
it is advisable to always have a glass on hand. Also a few specimens
of bills, good and bad, to compare and examine at first is necessary to
make the theory practical. The following is the list of</p>

<p>It is believed, and experience has proved, that the above combination
of rules is arranged in the most judicious and effective order, and the
best adapted for practical use in detecting at sight that could be devised.
It is in fact nearly the order in which a genuine plate is originally
got up. First the “Geometric Lathe” dies, “Medallions,” and “Vignettes”
are transferred; then the “Lettering” and “Ruling Engine”
work, next the “Paper and Printing,” “Signatures and filling up,” and
lastly, after all is finished, the “General appearance” of the whole.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</h2>

<p>That this work merits the encouraging praise and high appreciation
it has met with seems to be confirmed by its rapid sale and by the permanent,
steady demand yet existing for it, as well now as when it was
first issued in 1849. Various miserable imitations of it (infringements
of the copyright) have been attempted in the form of circulars, pamphlets,
and pretended outlines of it published in newspapers and Bank-note
Lists, but of such a superficial and abortive character as to entirely
fail of being a truthful synopsis and answering no particularly
useful purpose in the detection of counterfeits. This work stands pre-eminent
and alone. The only objection heretofore made to it was its
high price. It is now reduced to as low a price as it can possibly be
afforded, and the present edition improved.</p>

<h2>RULES.</h2>

<h3>RULE I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GEOMETRIC LATHE.<br />
(<i>Infallible when imitated.</i>)</span></h3>

<p>The “Geometric Lathe” is a very perfect and costly Engraving
Engine, which produces very fine and beautiful ornamental
patterns of geometric circles of such complication,
uniformity, and exquisite perfection, that it cannot possibly be
imitated in any manner. It engraves or turns the circular or
oval patterns on the dies, on which the figures representing the
denomination of the note are placed. A sketch of this engine
is quoted from “<cite>Nicholson’s Operative Mechanic</cite>.”</p>

<p>“One of the most important securities to the paper currency
of nearly the whole commercial world at the present time
arises from the invention of transferring engravings, and the
work produced by the Geometric Lathe, invented by Mr. <span class="smcap">Asa
Spencer</span>, while a resident of New London, in the State of
Connecticut. The application of this Lathe-work for the security
of Bank Notes was first made by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Fairman,
Draper &amp; Co.</span>, of Philadelphia, in 1816, and from its great
beauty and difficulty of imitation, Mr. Spencer was induced to
repair to England in 1819, for the purpose of securing the paper
currency of that country. As had been expected, this
work was put to the severest test which the combined talent
of its great metropolis could invent, and having passed this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
trial in a very satisfactory manner, it was subsequently adopted
very generally by the Banks and Bankers of England and
Scotland.</p>

<p>“The Geometric Lathe differs materially from any other
<em>turning</em> engine hitherto invented. The only one which has
any similarity in the work produced, is the “Rose Engine;”
but that is only capable of copying patterns previously made
upon guides, while the Geometric Lathe forms its own patterns,
which are all <em>originals</em>, and as various and unlimited as
the ‘Kaleidoscope.’…</p>

<p>“The impossibility of successfully imitating this work by any
process of hand-work within the reach of the whole combined
talent of counterfeiters will not be doubted when the severe
test to which it has been submitted is recollected: and even
supposing any combination of counterfeiters to be in possession
of the different machines and appendages necessary to effect
their object, they would soon find that the time which would
be required to learn the use of these implements in secret,
could be more profitably employed in any honest occupation.”</p>

<p>The patterns produced by the Geometric Lathe are concentric,
eccentric, or geometric circles, radiating from a common
centre, and beautifully interwoven into each other, forming a
perfectly regular and uniform ‘fancy’ pattern, so exactly true
and uniform in its radiations, that there never is the slightest
possible irregularity or imperfection. It is because the patterns
are of such exquisite beauty and perfection, and at the
same time extremely fine and complicated, that it is utterly
impossible to imitate it by hand or by any process whatever.
The Geometric Lathe does not engrave the patterns immediately
upon the plate itself, but the patterns are transferred to
the plate from roller dies or cylinders, generally in two places,
as a majority of bills contain two dies alike, sometimes four,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
one in each corner. Being single-transferred the patterns are
reversed, and are then <em>white</em> circles or lines upon a <em>black ground</em>.
Of course whenever there are two or four dies that pretend to
be alike in a genuine bill, they will all be exactly alike, being
all transferred from the same one die. See the two transfers
of the die in the <a href="#steelplate">steel plate</a> containing the ‘3.’ In imitations
of Lathe-work in counterfeit bills there will be a failure in
two ways: first, in imitating regularity of the pattern, which
is attempted to be done by hand, and also it is cut directly on
the plate instead of transferring, so that what in the genuine
is black <em>spaces</em>, is <em>engraved</em> black in the counterfeits, leaving
white spaces and black dots, resembling cobble-stones&mdash;the
white spaces between which made to resemble white lines,
while it can easily be seen that it is only irregular black <em>dots</em>
and scratches instead of white lines or geometric circles. Secondly,
a failure in getting two dies exactly alike in the same
bill&mdash;that is, where they pretend to be alike. If done by hand
there cannot be two fine and complicated patterns made <em>exactly
alike</em>; but in the genuine, where the pattern on one die or cylinder
is rolled or transferred in two or more places, they will
all of course be exactly alike. This same work is to be seen
on the backs of watches, called “Engine Turning.”</p>

<p>Diagrams A, B, C, and D, represent the appearance of various
<span class="smcapuc">IMITATIONS</span> of Geometric Lathe-work when magnified
with a powerful glass. There is generally a studied effort to
represent <em>white</em> intersecting curved lines or Geometric Circles
on a <em>black</em> ground; in fact trying to imitate <span class="smcap">Transferring</span>;
but there will always be found, as in the above diagrams,
nothing but confused black dots and semi-circular scratches,
arranged so as to give it the same “<em>general appearance</em>” as the
genuine, when held a little distance off. Sometimes there is
no effort made to imitate the <em>white lines</em>, and there will be seen
nothing but confused black dots and irregular black curved
lines, mixed up together. Diagram E represents a magnified
oblong-die, of alternating waved ruling, or eccentric parallels
transferred. See the two dies containing the figure “20” in
the <a href="#steelplate">steel plate</a> illustration. This work is done by the Ruling
Engine, and not by the Geometric Lathe; but as the work is
very similar, and imitations of it fail in exactly the same manner,
it is classed under the same rule. Diagram F is a representation
of a magnified counterfeit or imitation of this work
by hand; confused black dots on a <em>white</em> ground, instead of
true interwoven white lines of the genuine on a <em>black</em> ground.</p>

<h3>RULE II.<br />
<span class="smaller">RULING ENGINE.<br />
(<i>Infallible when Imitated.</i>)</span></h3>

<p>The Ruling Engine is used for shading the letters, skies,
&amp;c. in genuine Bank notes. Underneath, and sometimes on
the lace of the letters in the title or name of the Bank, as
well as other lettering, there appears a soft, smooth, pale grayish
color, which to the naked eye appears to be painted with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
brush, but on close examination it proves to be fine parallel
lines, and when done by the Ruling Engine the lines are, 1st,
all exactly of the same size; 2d, regular distances apart; 3d,
perfectly parallel to each other; 4th, uniformity in their direction:
and it is <em>perfection</em> in these four points which gives it
such a smooth and perfect appearance, and the least deviation
from which will prove it to be hand-work. In counterfeits
this shading is imitated by hand, and it is impossible to do it
in this way as perfect as the Ruling Engine, as some lines will
be coarser than others, some wider apart than others, not parallel,
and some not perfectly straight, and all are apt to be
more or less <em>tapered</em> off when done by hand with the graver,
which is not the case with the genuine, and which gives the
whole a scratchy appearance; in fact, the least deviation in
any of the points will show at once, and destroy the appearance
of the whole. In titles, or the name of a bank, where
the letters are alike, as for instance,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bank.jpg" width="500" height="56" alt="THE BANK OF&mdash;&mdash;, written in a slanting font" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">the shading in the genuine always is done all the way across all
at once, and there is a perfect <em>uniformity</em> from beginning to end;
the lines all point exactly in the same direction, whether horizontal
or diagonal, on the “T” in “THE” as on “F” in “OF,”
preserving the same angle and fineness throughout. In counterfeits,
where the letters are shaded by hand, one letter at a time, if
the lines pretend to be horizontal, some are apt to slant a little
downwards or upwards, some letters shaded a little finer than
others&mdash;that is where they are intended to be alike and uniform.
This principle of <span class="smcap">Uniformity</span> in shading is very important,
and should always be noticed. See the words “<span class="smcap">Universal</span>,”
“<span class="smcap">Detector</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Banks</span>,” and “<span class="smcap">United States</span>,”
in the <a href="#steelplate">steel plate</a>, which are shaded by the Ruling Engine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
while the word “<span class="smcap">Counterfeit</span>” is shaded by hand to illustrate
counterfeit work.</p>

<p>The sky in vignettes in the genuine is sometimes ruled by
the Ruling Engine, and always appears soft, smooth, and perfectly
done, and in this case the lines taper off gradually.
Imitations of this by hand will appear uneven and scratchy,
some lines coarser than others, and some wider apart than
others. All genuine skies, however, are not done by the Ruling
Engine, but are sometimes fine dots or wavy lines, which
fade off into fine dots, and sometimes heavy rolling clouds, circular
lines, but it is always done perfectly and beautifully, and
looks smooth and natural, being always done in genuine bills
by first class artists, while the sky in counterfeits is generally
apt to appear coarse and scratchy, and not fading off gradually
enough.</p>

$3000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h3>RULE III.<br />
<span class="smaller">MEDALLION OR PENTOGRAPH RULING.<br />
(<i>Infallible when Imitated.</i>)</span></h3>

<p>The Medallions are raised patterns, or line-engravings, generally
representing a head, or some raised fancy patterns in genuine
Bank Notes, which look as if raised up from the paper.
They are called medallions because they are copied always
from and represent the pattern upon a medal. It is done by
the Pentograph Ruling Engine, which, guided by the medal,
rules the whole pattern in <em>full length lines</em>, and the dies are
<em>double</em> transferred to the plate, which makes the lines <em>black</em>,
the same in appearance as if the pattern was ruled directly
upon the plate itself by the engine. This work is done upon
the same principle in mechanics of “<em>guides</em>,” as shoe-lasts are
turned by the “Last turning machine.” A model last is used
for a guide to the machine, which turns out of a rough-hewn
block of wood a last exactly like the model. Thus in genuine
medallion ruling there is always a medal or coin used for a
“<em>guide</em>.” The points in determining genuine medallions from
imitations engraved by hand, are, the lines in the genuine all run
in one general direction; they are always <em>full length lines</em>
across the whole pattern, the lines are all <em>exactly the same size</em>
or caliber, they <em>never cross each other</em>. Every undulation in the
pattern on the guide or medal is copied with the most <em>unerring
exactness</em>, and articulated <em>distinctly</em> and beautifully correct,
which is impossible to be done so perfectly by hand. In the
counterfeit the lines are apt to <em>break off</em> in the midst of the
pattern; some lines are apt to be <em>coarser than others</em>, which
gives it a scratchy appearance. In the genuine, the lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
crowd together in the parts of the pattern that appear depressed
or sunken, and spread apart more where the pattern
appears raised and looks whiter, producing the lights and shades
with the most magnificent ease and effect. In the counterfeit
done by hand the lines do not crowd and spread apart again,
according to the pattern, with such ease and effect, but the
patterns appear stiff, flat, or imperfectly raised. There is always
one of two ways or alternatives in which the hand-work
imitations appear to fail. If they succeed in making the lines
full length, as they ought to be, then the pattern will inevitably
appear <em>flat</em> in expression, imperfectly raised; but if they
succeed in making the pattern look <em>raised</em>, as it ought to be,
then there will inevitably be <em>broken</em> or <em>forked lines</em> all through
the midst of the pattern. It seems impossible to combine in
hand-work imitations of this extremely fine and complicated
work full length lines, and at the same time a perfectly <em>finished</em>
and <em>raised</em> pattern, which the Pentograph Ruling Engine always
does in the highest perfection.</p>

</div>

<p>Diagrams I and J represent the appearance of counterfeit
Medallions when magnified. K represents the appearance of
a genuine Medallion as magnified 10 to 15 times. <em>Every line
is full length</em>, and exactly of the <em>same size</em>. In J the lines <em>break
off</em> and <em>fork together</em> all through the midst of the pattern, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
some lines a little <em>coarser</em> than others, which gives it a scratchy
appearance.</p>

<p>Whenever there are two or more medallions in a genuine
bill that pretend to be alike, they are always exactly alike;
being double-transferred from the same original die; (see medallion
heads marked ‘3’ in the <a href="#steelplate">steel plate</a>,) but two medallions
cannot be made exactly alike separately by hand. The following
extract in relation to this work is quoted from the
Mechanic’s Magazine, 1835: “The Journal of the Franklin
Institute for September contains an elegant engraved portrait
of Wm. Congreve, the dramatist, executed by Wm. A. Spencer
of Philadelphia, in the manner described, and has inserted the
following proofs that the invention can be claimed for America.
‘Believing that the credit of the invention of a machine
for medal ruling is due to America, we will briefly set forth
our proofs, and then speak of the improvements which of late
years the method has undergone. The proofs to be given of
the existence and state of the machine are to be derived from
the results produced by it. In 1817, by the use of a machine
which had been invented in Philadelphia, Christian Gobrecht,
die-sinker, produced an engraving upon copper, from a medal
having upon it the head of Alexander of Russia. From this
engraving impressions were taken and distributed. One of
these impressions we have seen. In 1819, Asa Spencer, now
of the firm of Draper, Underwood &amp; Co. bank-note engravers,
took with him to London a machine of the kind above alluded
to, which was designed principally for straight and waved-line
ruling. This machine was used in London during the
year just mentioned, and the mode of ruling waved lines, and
of copying medals, was then exhibited and explained by Mr.
Spencer to several artists&mdash;particularly Mr. Terrell, who took
by permission a drawing of the machine, for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
having one made for his own use. Little however was done
in the way of medal ruling until about three years since, (1832,)
when a desire to apply the method to the engraving of designs
for bank notes caused it to be revived by Mr. Spencer, who
bestowed great attention upon it, and overcame the difficulties
met with in the onset.’&mdash;The peculiar construction of this machine
has never been made a secret, nor has it ever been patented,
although prudential motives have required that it should
not be minutely described, and thus be placed in the hands of
those by whom its use might be perverted. The operations
performed by this machine are the ruling of parallel straight
lines at any required distances apart, either continuous or
broken; ruling converging straight lines; ruling waved lines,
the waves being either similar, varying by more or less imperceptible
gradations; and medal ruling or transferring to copper
the fac-simile of a medal without injuring its surface, the
waved lines presenting a copy of the minutest parts of the
medal.”</p>

<h3>RULE IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">VIGNETTES&mdash;A GENERAL RULE.<br />
<i>Faces, Eyes, Stippling, Hair, Drapery, Limbs, Scenery, &amp;c.</i></span></h3>

<p>Rule IV. relates to the Vignettes, to notice whether they
appear to come up to the usual standard of perfection in the
following points: the faces, eyes, stippling, hair, drapery, limbs,
scenery, landscapes, water and agricultural scenes, &amp;c. This
work is always done by hand, both in the genuine and counterfeit;
but in the genuine it is done by <em>first-class artists</em>; men
who are at the head of their profession, and who can always
get such a complete remuneration for their labor that there
cannot possibly be any temptation for them to counterfeit. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is only second, third, fourth, and sometimes <em>hundredth</em>-rate artists
that counterfeit:&mdash;runaway apprentices and cast-off journeymen,
and possibly amateurs. The points to observe are
first, the human face, stippling, and the eyes. This is the most
difficult of any part of the Vignette to execute well, and fails
in counterfeits, more than any other part of the 4th Rule. In
the genuine, the eyes have a perfectly natural expression, while
in counterfeits they are, generally, merely two clumsy dots.
The <em>stippling</em> is the beautiful artistic arrangement of the fine
dots which produce the shading&mdash;the smooth, even, soft <em>rounding</em>
of the features, the cheeks, nose, lips, chin, and limbs; this
fails <em>invariably</em> in counterfeits&mdash;the features, and generally the
limbs also, appearing <em>flat</em>, scratchy, inexpressive, and inanimate.
The human hair in the genuine will look soft, silky,
and natural; displaying a <em>lustre</em> in portions where the light
appears to strike it. In counterfeits the hair generally appears
<em>stiff</em>, coarse, <em>wiry</em>, lifeless, and unnatural. The drapery in the
genuine beautifully represents the folds and texture of different
kinds of cloth; sometimes the dark, heavy and glossy appearance
of broadcloth is produced; sometimes the light, flowing
appearance of silk or muslin&mdash;the folds always look easy and
<em>flowing</em>&mdash;no stiffness. In counterfeits the drapery generally
appears scratchy and <em>stiff</em>, sometimes having the <em>solid</em> appearance
of cast iron, and sometimes like coarse wire-cloth, inexplicably
twisted up in a snarl in trying to imitate the easy and
natural folds of the genuine. The limbs, hands, or feet are
always well done in the genuine, but generally fail in counterfeits.
It is a very difficult matter to execute well, and it requires
a first-rate artist to produce an elegant-shaped hand or
foot and in an easy position. To engrave human figures correctly
it is first necessary for the artist to acquire a <em>thorough</em>
knowledge of Anatomy. Smoke in the genuine is always well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
done&mdash;generally in fine curved lines, and sometimes in straight
parallels, fading off gradually at the edges. In counterfeits the
smoke gradually appears coarse and <em>scratchy</em>. Also notice
whether the “perspective” is managed rightly: the lights and
shades, and the forms of animals, horses, cows, &amp;c. &amp;c. whether
truthfully portrayed. Vignettes are transferred to the plates
from <em>double</em> transferred cylinder dies.</p>

<p>“Chambers’s Information for the People” says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Engraving, in all its various branches, is a species of labor
which probably requires greater remuneration than any other
department of art&mdash;for not only must there be a great degree
of patience and perseverance beyond what is required in most
other employments, especially in undertaking the engraving of
a genuine bank-note plate, which must be perfect in all its
parts, showing the lights and shades true to life&mdash;one part corresponding
with another as though nature herself had formed
the impression. Such of course is the intention of the artist,
who must be a finished workman before he can receive employment
in this capacity; the perfection of the execution being of
course the only great difficulty to overcome. This will be
seen from the fact that in all cases from ten to fifteen artists are
employed upon one bank note plate, and as this employment
necessarily calls into its service the very best talent that can be
secured, it follows as a matter of fact that we are perfectly safe
in looking to the perfection of a note for the genuineness of the
bill. Each artist has a separate part to execute; and as the
whole plate is made of different parts, called “dies” or “cuts,”
it is therefore evident that no band of counterfeiters can accomplish
their designs&mdash;it being impossible.”</p>

<p>[See the Vignette marked “4” in the <a href="#steelplate">steel plate</a>; also the
portrait of Washington.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h3>RULE V.<br />
<span class="smaller">LETTERING, AND ENGRAVERS’ NAMES.</span></h3>

<p>Rule V. relates to the perfection of lettering. In the genuine
the lettering is done by a first-class artist, whose particular
branch it is to devote exclusively to that part of the work
alone, and of course he arrives at a degree of perfection that
could not be approached without such a sub-division of labor.
In the genuine the letters are all exactly of the same size,
where they <em>pretend</em> to be, and on the same <em>angle</em> and same size
stroke, where they pretend to be. There are two great points
to observe as regards lettering, viz. <em>neatness</em> in form, and <em>uniformity</em>&mdash;the
most important is <span class="smcapuc">UNIFORMITY</span>. The want of
uniformity in size, slant, distances apart, thickness of stroke,
and any deviation from the line of the letters of a title, or the
name of a bank for instance, will show counterfeit work.
See the lettering in the word <span class="smcap">Counterfeit</span> in the steel-plate
illustration compared with the lettering of the “<span class="smcap">Universal
Detector</span>,” “<span class="smcap">United States</span>,” &amp;c. The engraved writing
in the genuine, “Promise to pay on demand,” &amp;c. is always
beautifully done, the down strokes <em>uniform in size and slant</em>,
and the hair strokes extremely fine, the curves <em>easy</em> and <em>flowing</em>,
while in counterfeits the down strokes are apt to point in
different angles, and the hair strokes coarse, and the curves
<em>stiff</em> and defective. But perhaps the most important part of
the 5th Rule, as it fails <em>invariably</em>, without exception, in all
counterfeits, is the engravers’ names or “imprint,” which in
the genuine is a <em>die</em> cut in the most perfect manner, the letters
very neat and perfect and perfectly <em>uniform</em> in every respect.
In counterfeits it is not a die, but letters cut in by hand, and
never so perfect as the genuine, but clumsy, not uniform distances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
apart, nor in size and slant, and not all in a straight
line, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>RULE VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">SIGNATURES AND FILLING UP.</span></h3>

<p>The 6th Rule relates to the signatures, and filling up the
No., date, to whom payable, cashier, and president. To notice
whether the whole filling up appears in two or three different
hands, as it ought to be. In the genuine the <em>No.</em> and <em>date</em> is
generally written by a bank clerk, who writes a very neat,
rapid <em>business</em> hand&mdash;but of course there may be exceptions to
this Rule&mdash;but in counterfeits the No. and date is <em>almost invariably
clumsy and unbusiness-like</em>. Where the officers’ signatures
are imitated there will be a slow, studied, and stiff appearance,
not easy, natural and <em>original</em>-looking. Some men
acquire an almost intuitive knowledge of <em>original</em> handwriting
at sight, and the writer has seen many excellent judges of
Bank Notes who have acknowledged that they were guided
almost entirely by the signatures, even of strange banks.
Auto-chirography may be studied as a science, but it can only
be acquired by long experience, and it is not infallible: the
best judges of writing might possibly be deceived sometimes.
In some counterfeits the signatures are lithographed <i>fac-similes</i>,
sometimes traced over with a pen. In writing with a pen the
ink thoroughly saturates the paper, but leaves a smooth edge
to the stroke, and has somewhat of a glossy appearance, while
the printed <i>fac-similes</i> always have a <em>stamped</em> appearance, the
stroke of a dead color and rough edge, not saturated or lively,
like writing ink. If traced over with a pen there will be
places, especially in the hair strokes, where the pen does not
follow the curves in the stroke correctly. In cases where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fraudulent impressions are obtained from the genuine plate, or
where the plate itself is stolen, the 6th Rule is all that will
detect; but when such a case happens there are always measures
taken by the bank to meet it&mdash;a new plate is ordered,
and the old emission called in.</p>

<h3>RULE VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">PAPER AND GENERAL APPEARANCE.</span></h3>

<p>Rule VII. relates to the paper, printing, and the general appearance
of a note. Genuine bank-note paper is made of linen
or silk, or a mixture of both, of a firm texture, and of a superior
quality, (see the paper on which the steel-plate illustration
is printed.) This paper is manufactured expressly for the
banks and engraving companies alone, and counterfeiters can
seldom get hold of paper of this kind, but are generally compelled
to use slazy or half cotton paper. A counterfeit note is
seldom printed as well as the genuine, but often blurred, and
poor ink. As to the “general appearance,” this is produced
by a combination of all the Rules. If all the Rules are good,
and the note well printed, the “general appearance” of course
will be perfect; but if there is any one or more of the Rules
bad, the harmony of the “general appearance” will be interrupted.
But if a genuine note is old, worn, and has been wet,
the general appearance may be bad, but the other rules will all
be good, and prove the note to be genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h3>ANASTATIC TRANSFERS, OR LITHOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p>There was an emission, five or ten years ago, of some counterfeits
on the National Bank, Providence, 2s and 5s. They
were not regularly-engraved plates; and as the exact process
by which they were got up is unknown, they are supposed to
be anastatic transfers, or lithographs. They have a very
<em>smoky</em>, brown, blurred, and <em>indistinct</em> appearance, something
similar, but inferior to, mezzotinto engraving. It is supposed
that the process, whatever it was, did not succeed well enough,
as there never have any appeared like them since. The shading
of the letters appeared to be a solid brown coloring&mdash;no
lines perceptible scarcely, and this was the character of the engraving
of the whole note.</p>

<p>The new counterfeit tens on the State Bank of Ohio are exceedingly
well done, though easily detected by the Rules.
One kind&mdash;that with an X in the center of the vignette&mdash;appears
to be a lithograph, a transfer from the genuine bill; but
the impression produced appears to have been faint and dim in
many places, and re-touched with <em>a graver</em>;&mdash;thus easily detected
on examination, although very dangerous counterfeits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h3>ALTERATIONS FROM BROKEN BANKS.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE “MAGIC THREE.”</span></h3>

<p>The first seven Rules go to show whether a bill is from a
genuine plate or not. We now proceed to discuss <em>Altered Bills</em>.
In altered bills, where a genuine bill of a broken bank is altered
by the counterfeiter to some sound bank, there are three
places in which the alteration must be made, viz: First, the
<em>State</em>; Second, <em>Title</em>, or name of the bank; and Third, the
<em>Town</em>. They are generally extracted, or the letters dissolved
by some chemical process, and the name of another bank, state,
and town, substituted in their place. The Ruling Engine
shading on the genuine will be imitated by hand in the substituted
“title” and “town,” and this will detect it as well as
the clumsiness of the letters generally, and also the white
streak or bleaching of the paper around and between the substituted
letters. Sometimes the “bank” may be in the same
State, and there will be only two places to alter besides the
signatures; and sometimes the broken bank bills of the <em>same
name or title</em> are selected, (for instance the Commercial Bank,
Millington, Md.) and there will also be two places to alter besides
the signatures, viz: the “State” and “Town.” In dissolving
the signatures of the broken bank by some acid and
substituting imitations of the proper signatures, they generally
look <em>faded</em>, which is caused by a little acid still remaining in
the paper&mdash;and also the whole filling up, signatures and all,
are in one handwriting. By noticing these three points, the
“State,” “Title,” and “Town,” (the Magic Three,) and the
signatures, the detection of any alteration from a broken bank
will be a very simple and easy matter. For instance, one of
the best alterations, and one that has deceived thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
good judges when it was first issued in 1849, were 1s, Madison
County Bank, Cazenovia, N. Y. vignette three females. The
“New York Safety Fund” and “Cazenovia” were rather
clumsily lettered and the MADIS- was <em>shaded by hand</em>, while
-ON COUNTY BANK was shaded perfectly by the Ruling
Engine. This shows of course an alteration from some other
name that ended in -ON; most probably CLINTON. There
was no bleaching or scratching of the paper around the substituted
letters, and the signatures were not faded, this shows that
it was not an <em>altered bill</em> but an <em>altered plate</em>, probably a “wild
cat” bank plate, that was sold at auction, in New York, in
1841.</p>

<h3>ALTERED DENOMINATIONS.</h3>

<p>This is altering from a smaller to a larger denomination&mdash;as
1s altered to 5s, &amp;c. &amp;c. This is done in various ways. One
way it is done by pasting; but it is more generally done by
extracting the ink of the figure and the die containing it by
some chemical fluid, and printing in its place a counterfeit die,
or sometimes a stolen genuine die containing a larger denomination.
The words, “ONE DOLLAR,” which generally is
shaded by the Ruling Engine, are extracted, and “FIVE DOLLARS”
substituted in its place and <em>shaded by hand</em>. A difference
also in the color of the ink of the substituted denominations
from the rest of the note will generally be seen. Sometimes
the letters of the substituted denomination are <em>common
printer’s type</em>, the “old English letter,” 🖙 <span class="gothic">Twenty Dollars</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h2>OLD-STYLE PLATES.</h2>

<p>Counterfeits upon the old-fashioned plates, “Perkin’s stereotype
plate” and others, all that contain any <em>transferred</em> dies,
the pattern <em>white</em> upon a black ground, can be detected by the
imitation of transferring. <a href="#abcdef">Diagrams E, F, on page 16</a>, also
<a href="#lm">diagrams, L, M</a>, will illustrate this principle. In the genuine
it is machine waved-ruling transferred from dies, while in the
counterfeit this is imitated by engraving the <em>black spaces</em> immediately
upon the plate itself, and attempting to make it fit
so as to have the appearance of being transferred. L represents
the genuine, (though imperfect,) M represents the counterfeit.
There are four out of the seven Rules that will apply
to the old fashioned “Perkin’s stereotype” and most other old-style
plates, viz: the 1st Rule, or Transferring; the 5th Rule,
the Lettering, especially the mass of small lettering, “One
Dollar,” “One Dollar,” in the body of the note; 6th Rule, the
Signatures and filling up; 7th Rule, Paper and general appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="lm">

<img src="images/fig-lm.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="letter-l">L</span> <span class="letter-r">M</span></p>

</div>

<h2>THE PIECING OPERATION.</h2>

<p>This process of increasing the number of bills from a given
quantity by piecing&mdash;as making ten bills out of nine&mdash;appears
to be done&mdash;as seen in a specimen lately&mdash;by cutting off perpendicularly
a piece, one ninth of a bill, and pasting in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
place a piece of a <em>counterfeit</em> on the same bank and denomination
to match. The same process will be then carried on with
the nine bills, only that in each bill the piece would be cut out
in a different place. When the nine bills are thus all pieced
there would be <em>just enough surplus pieces left</em> of the genuine to
paste together with one piece of the counterfeit to make a <em>complete
bill like the rest</em>, and this would be the profit on the operation.
The counterfeit part of the bills appeared to be intentionally
defaced, so as to be nearly illegible, in order to escape
detection. The banks will only redeem such bills at their estimated
proportionate value.</p>

<h2>SUMMING UP.<br />
<span class="smaller">PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE RULES.</span></h2>

<p>No matter how much a bill may be worn and defaced, if the
name of the bank and the denomination can be seen, the application
of these rules will enable a person to decide at sight
whether a bill is genuine or not. The 1st Rule, the Geometric
Lathe-work being infallible, any imitation can be detected
at a glance, when of course the bill must be a counterfeit
without looking any further. But a great many counterfeits
contain <em>stolen genuine dies</em>, when of course the 1st Rule
will fail to detect; but there is always enough else to detect a
bad bill. The 2d Rule, the Ruling Engine work&mdash;any imitation
of this can be detected at a glance. This rule detects oftener
than almost any other rule, and therefore it is one of the
most useful of all the rules. In some old-fashioned genuine
plates, especially in some of the old New England plates, there
may occur an exception to this rule, the shading of the letters
being done by hand. Now and then, but very rarely, a counterfeit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
is seen containing genuine Ruling Engine work; but in
such a case there are plenty of the other rules to fail. Counterfeiters
may get some genuine work, but they cannot get a
<em>perfect combination of all the work genuine</em>. There is always
<em>something lacking</em>. It is against their interest to invest so
much capital as would enable them to get everything perfect.
Besides, they can never get the services of a sufficient number
of first-class artists, and <em>all</em> the necessary machinery. 3d Rule,
the Medallions&mdash;see if the heads or other ornamental patterns
of this work look raised, distinct, clear and smooth, and the
lines all <em>full length</em>, and the most skillful imitations by hand
can be detected at a glance. 4th Rule, the Vignettes&mdash;whether
they come up to the usual standard of perfection, especially
the human eye and face. Sometimes the vignette in a counterfeit
is a stolen genuine die, generally much worn. A lot of
old worn out dies were sold at auction in New York in 1841 to
the highest bidder, and some got into counterfeiters’ hands.
5th Rule, the Lettering and Engravers’ Names. It is an exceedingly
rare thing indeed to find anything near first-class
lettering in a counterfeit; but the Engravers’ names <em>always
fail</em>&mdash;the writer has never seen a single exception. 6th Rule,
the Signatures and Filling Up. Counterfeits are so often palpably
filled up all in one handwriting as to make this an important
rule; also look out for lithographed ‘fac-similes.’ 7th
Rule, Paper and General Appearance. Experience has proved
that it is always best in judging a doubtful bill to apply the
rules in their proper order, one after the other, commencing
with the 1st, otherwise a person might forget one or two rules,
and neglect to apply the very rule that would most palpably
condemn the bill. The writer has never seen a counterfeit
where less than <em>two</em> of the rules would condemn it at sight,
and the rest genuine work. But the majority of counterfeits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
are condemned by three, four, five, six, and very often the
whole seven rules.</p>

<h2>THE STEEL-PLATE ILLUSTRATION.</h2>

<p>The <a href="#steelplate">steel plate</a>, next to the title-page, contains a standard
specimen of all the different styles of genuine engraving on
all bank notes of all banks in the United States. But <em>those
particular patterns</em> or dies do not belong to any regular Bank-note
Engraving Co. in the U.S. They, with others, were
sold at auction some years since, and duplicate dies have been
made from them and scattered over the country, New York,
Boston and Philadelphia, and some of them have got into
counterfeiters’ hands, who use them in their spurious issues.
Therefore no pattern like any one of these will ever be seen
in a genuine note; but one or more of the duplicates of them
will often be seen in a counterfeit. The plate therefore serves
two purposes&mdash;1st, illustrating genuine and perfect work;
2d, to guard against genuine auction dies used in counterfeits.</p>

<p>Another auction vignette die, often seen in counterfeits, but
never in a genuine bill, is a woman sitting by a sheaf of
wheat, canal lock on the right and locomotive and bridge on
the left.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
